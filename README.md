Fintech Microservices Loan Processing System
A production-ready microservices architecture for scalable loan processing in financial technology, implementing classical design patterns (Factory, Observer, Repository, and Saga) as described in the research paper "Microservices Architecture in Fintech: A Case Study on Scalable Loan Processing with Classical Design Patterns".

•	Sub-125ms response times meeting FedNow requirements
🚀 Key Features
•	Domain-Driven Design: Clean separation of business domains
•	Classical Design Patterns: Factory, Observer, Repository, and Saga patterns
•	High Performance: 10,000 RPS capacity with horizontal scaling
